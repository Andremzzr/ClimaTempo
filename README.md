I'm working on this challange in the past few days, using HTML/CSS and PHP (I know that my css sucks lol, I'm trying to improve it)


I used the Open Weather API to fetch the weather data from the cities that you type in: </br>
https://openweathermap.org/ </br>

I also based myself on the ClimaTempo challange, I didn't use their data because I thought that is more fun to use a real API:  </br>
